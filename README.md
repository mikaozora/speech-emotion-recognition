## Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using deep learning techniques. The project explores various models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN+LSTM architecture to classify emotions from speech data. The Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset is used to train and evaluate the models.
